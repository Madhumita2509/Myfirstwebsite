<p>Coffee beans must be ground and brewed to create a beverage. The criteria for choosing a method include flavor and economy. Almost all methods of preparing
coffee require that the beans be ground and then mixed with hot water long enough to allow the flavor to emerge but not so long as to draw out bitter
compounds. The liquid can be consumed after the spent grounds are removed.<p> water is used to extract the flavor, the ratio of coffee grounds to water (the brew ratio), additional flavorings such as sugar, milk, and spices,
and the technique to be used to separate spent grounds. Ideal holding temperatures range from 85 to 88 °C (185 to 190 °F) to as high as 93 °C (199 °F)
and the ideal serving temperature is 68 to 79 °C .<p>The recommended brew ratio for non-espresso coffee is around 55 to 60 grams
of grounds per litre of water, or two level tablespoons for a 150-to-180-millilitre.

<h3> Espresso Machine</h3>
<p> Anyone who knows anything about coffee knows what an espresso machine is – they’ve been keeping us caffeinated since 1901.
Today they come in various shapes and sizes, with loads of features and gimmicks.</p><p> Don’t get confused by flash machines though
 because the basics are the same: pressurized water is pushed through a chamber/puck of finely ground coffee beans, through
  a filter, resulting in what we call a shot of espresso.</p>

 <h3>Moka Pot / Stovetop Espresso Brewing</h3>
<p>Don’t have a few hundred bucks to spend on an espresso machine, but still looking for that espresso-shot-like-kick that comes from a
 pressurized brew? The stovetop espresso maker AKA the Moka pot is the next best thing.</p>
<p>The magic behind the Moka pot is in its 3 chambered brew process. Water in the bottom chamber boils, and the
steam causes pressure that pushes water up through the coffee grounds into the top chamber.​</p>

<h3>Aeropress</h3>
<p>he AeroPress has a cult following among the traveling coffee community, and it looks more like a science
project rather than a coffee brewer. But if you ask us; </p><p>it’s the best thing that happened to coffee. And many
 people say it brews the best coffee they’ve ever tasted.</p>
<p>Keeping s**t simple is the name of the game; the right water temperature, the right level of air pressure
 and the right size grind leaves you with an excellent tasting brew in a matter of minutes!</p><p> (Seriously,
  it’s one of the fastest coffee makers you can get your mitts on.) And many people say it brews the best
   coffee they’ve ever tasted.</p>

<h3>French Press</h3>
<p>The French press is the unofficial mascot of home brewed coffee; it’s been steeping coffee in households
 since before your grandparents were born, and it has a very loyal, cult following among the home barista
  community</p>
  <p>It’s likely thanks to multiple reasons, but our money is on the fact that its super easy to use,
  can be picked up for pocket change (almost) and produces a brew with a distinct taste and feel like no other
   method.</p>
   <p> Here’s a list of great french press makers if you’re in need.If you’re into the French Press use
    the right coffee grind as this little known b</p>
