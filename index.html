<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed,
and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees,depending on the desired flavor.</p>
<p> Roasted beans are ground and then brewed
with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>
<p> It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways
(e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.</p>
