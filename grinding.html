<p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.
The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds
to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods.</p><p> Beans that are
too finely ground for the brewing method in which they are used will expose too much surface area
to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh, "over-extracted" taste.</p><p> At the other extreme,
an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is used. Due to the importance of
 a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.</p>

<h3>Burr-grinding</h3>
<p>Burr mills use two revolving abrasive elements, such as wheels or conical grinding elements,
between which the coffee beans are crushed or "torn" with little frictional heating.</p><p> The
process of squeezing and crushing of the beans releases the coffee's oils, which are
then more easily extracted during the infusion process with hot water, making the coffee taste richer
and smoother.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Chopping</h3>

<p>Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in
a blade grinder designed specifically for coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender.</p><p> Device
 of this sort are cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and will produce particles
  of widely varying sizes, while ideally all particles should have the same size, appropriate for the
  method of brewing.</p><p> Moreover, the particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process,
  which makes it difficult to achieve a consistent grind from batch to batch.</p>

<p>Blade grinders create “coffee dust” that can clog up sieves in espresso machines and French presses,
 and are best suited for drip coffee makers. They are not recommended for grinding coffee for use
 with pump espresso machines.[2][3]</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Pounding</h3>

<p>Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee require that the grounds be almost powdery in fineness, finer than
can be achieved by most burr grinders.</p><p> Pounding the beans with a mortar and pestle can pulverise the
coffee finely enough.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Roller grinding</h3>
<p>In a roller grinder, the beans are ground between pairs of corrugated rollers. A roller grinder produces
a more even grind size distribution and heats the ground coffee less than other grinding methods.</p><p> However,
due to their size and cost, roller grinders are used exclusively by commercial and industrial scale coffee producers.</p><p>
Water-cooled roller grinders are used for high production rates as well as for fine grinds such as Turkish and espresso.</p>
